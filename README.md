## Meal Planner - What's in your fridge?

Your easy-to-use, handy application to track ingredients (or food in general) in your fridge. Don't know what to cook? Browse through suggested recipes and get inspired to prepare your next meal.<br />

Why this application? Because I simply love food. As a busy working adult juggling many responsibilities, I do get frustrated when my fridge is cluttered - certain foods expire and are forgotten (sometimes).
