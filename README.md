## Meal Planner - What's in your fridge?

Your easy-to-use, handy application to track ingredients (or food in general) in your fridge. Don't know what to cook? Browse through suggested recipes and get inspired to prepare your next meal. Best viewed on desktop.<br />

Why this application? I simply love food. As a busy working adult juggling many responsibilities, I do get frustrated when my fridge is cluttered - certain foods expire and are forgotten (sometimes).

### Project Planning

Time given to complete this project is about 1 week.<br />

I outlined the steps I took to build this project below:
1. Using a Kanban board, I planned out the Ice Box items that I wanted to implement in my project. I placed myself in the shoes of potential users of my application, and as an application user myself, I crafted the layout, design, features, and React components. View my Trello board here - https://trello.com/b/mH0NGpRU/meal-planner
2. Build the skeleton and components of the application using HTML, CSS (and Bootstrap), and React. Components include:
- Fridge (Main)
- Form to create ingredient
- Ingredient Card
- Form to update ingredient details
- Delete Button to remove ingredient
- Recipe List
- Recipe Card

### Ingredients Tracker
"Add New Ingredient" activates a form in which the user can fill in the name, type, purchase, and expiry dates.<br />
"Recipe Randomizer" leads the user to a list of suggested recipes for consideration.<br />

Click on the pencil and cross icons on each ingredient card to edit and delete the entry.<br/>

## Next Steps

- Add a filter and sort feature to categorise the listed ingredients e.g. filter by type, sort by ingredients which are expiring soon
- Mobile optimisation
